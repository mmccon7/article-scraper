# article-scraper

This app allows the user to scrape information from another webpage and incorporate it into their own webpage.  Kind of like using an API to pull information from one source and incorporate it into your own project, but in your own kind of way. In most cases you will want to verify that the source you are scraping actually allows scraping so you won't get into any trouble.

Have fun scraping!!
